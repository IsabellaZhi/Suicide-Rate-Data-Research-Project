# Suicide-Rate-Data-Research-Project

Overview:
- This research is about suicide rates in countries of different GDP per capita relative to demographics and mental health resources availability.
- In this project, I used Python and multiple packages to scrape online resources, clean data, perform statistical analysis, apply unsupervised learning, and apply linear and exponential regression models to generate informative data insights.

Components:
- The file named `Suicide Rate Data Research Project.ipynb` presented the results with dependable and intuitive visualization.
- The file named `Appendix_Web scraping + data cleaning.ipynb` is the web-scrping and data-cleaning I performed prior to analysis.
- The zip file named `Addition Material.zip` consists all datasets, and may need to be pulled to the same folder as `Suicide Rate Data Research Project.ipynb` for the latter to be able to execute.
